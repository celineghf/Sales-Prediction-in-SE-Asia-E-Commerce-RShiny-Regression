In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce, understanding the factors that influence sales volume is crucial for strategic decision-making. As a Data Analyst at Southeast Asian e-commerce company, the task at hand involves delving into a dataset encompassing the last twelve months. This dataset encapsulates key variables as follows:

y (Sales) : monthly sales volume (in thousands of USD),
x1 (Visitors) : number of website visitors per month,
x2 (Transactions) : number of monthly transactions,
x3 (Items/Transaction) : average number of items per transaction,
x4 (Rating) : customer satisfaction rating (scale 1–10),
x5 (Ads) : number of online advertisements run per month.
This data spans from January to December, with each month recording values for these variables. At this stage, the primary focus is to understand the dynamics and interplay among these variables and to design a multiple linear regression model to illustrate their complex relationships.

The goal is to leverage this data to construct a multiple linear regression model, allowing us to predict monthly sales based on the interplay of these variables. Additionally, the examination extends into the design of an interactive dashboard using R Shiny, providing a user-friendly interface for predicting sales by inputting various predictor data.

In this analytical journey, we will discuss the methodology for evaluating the regression model. This encompasses tests for assumptions, significance testing of coefficients, and the interpretation of these coefficients, providing a robust foundation for decision-making.

Furthermore, the implications of the model’s results on marketing strategy enhancement and sales amplification will be explored. By identifying the key variables influencing sales, the company can strategically focus efforts on improving specific aspects, thereby optimizing the marketing strategy.

Finally, the exploration extends into additional questions: which variable should be prioritized for improvement to increase sales, and how one can investigate the existence of a significant interaction between website visitors and the number of advertisements impacting sales. These questions will guide us in refining our approach to maximize the efficacy of marketing strategies and drive business growth.
